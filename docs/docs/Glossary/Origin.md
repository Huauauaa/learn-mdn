# Origin

Web content's **origin** is defined by the _scheme_ (protocol), _host_ (domain), and _port_ of the [URL](./URL.md) used to access it. Two objects have the same origin only when the scheme, host, and port all match.

Some operations are restricted to same-origin content, and this restriction can be lifted using [CORS](./CORS.md).
