# Object

[Object](../Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) refers to a data structure containing data and instructions for working with the data. Objects sometimes refer to real-world things, for example a `car` or `map` object in a racing game. [JavaScript](), Java, C++, Python, and Ruby are examples of [object-oriented programming]() languages.
