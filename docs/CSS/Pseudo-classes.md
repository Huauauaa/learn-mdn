# Pseudo-classes

<!-- todo hover -->

A CSS _pseudo-class_ is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example, [:hover](/) can be used to change a button's color when the user's pointer hovers over it.

```css
/* Any button over which the user's pointer is hovering */
button:hover {
  color: blue;
}
```
